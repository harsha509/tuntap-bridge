# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.0.4] - 2025-07-18

### Changed
- **Shutdown Responsibility**: Refactored the shutdown logic to be managed entirely by the TypeScript application layer, removing the signal handler from the C++ addon. This creates a single, reliable source of truth for shutdown orchestration and resolves the race condition.
- **Improved Thread Safety**: Hardened mutex locking around all public C++ methods to prevent potential race conditions during concurrent access.
- **Memory Safety**: Implemented smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`) for libuv handle management in the C++ addon to prevent potential memory leaks.

### Fixed
- **Process Hanging on Shutdown**: Resolved an issue where the Node.js process would hang on `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT). This was caused by a race condition between competing signal handlers in the C++ addon and the TypeScript application layer.


## [0.0.3] - 2025-01-07

### Added
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM)
- Thread safety with mutex protection in C++ code
- Custom error types for better error handling:
  - `TunTapError` - Base error class
  - `TunTapPermissionError` - Permission-related errors
  - `TunTapDeviceError` - Device availability errors
- Input validation for all methods:
  - IPv6 address format validation
  - MTU range checking (1280-65535)
  - Buffer size validation
  - Type checking for all parameters
- New methods:
  - `removeRoute()` - Remove routes from the interface
  - `getStats()` - Get network interface statistics
- Resource cleanup handlers for automatic cleanup on process exit
- Timeout handling for network operations
- Memory leak prevention with RAII pattern
- Debug logging support with `--debug` flag
- Comprehensive test suite

### Changed
- Updated to C++17 standard for better performance and modern features
- Improved error messages with more context and suggestions
